# Synthetic Financial Fraud Detection

This is my exercise after learning Machine Learning from Introduction Into Machine Learning published by O'REILLY. In this excercise I have practiced about handling with imbalanced dataset, data analysis by carefully looking for a patterns in the minor class, using the right metrics, searching the best parameters for certain model, and also model selection.

For using this code make sure to install sklearn, mglearn, pandas, matplotlib, and numpy. The dataset used in this notebook [https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1]. Check also my other notebook on kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/miqdude11/notebooks]. Also please read carefully for warnings in this notebook because fitting a model could be computanionally expensive.
